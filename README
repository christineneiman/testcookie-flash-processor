DESCRIPTION

    testcookie-flash-processor is a simple web server generating SWF for cookie installation.
    Server can be used with testcookie-nginx-module for setting cookie via flash plugin.

NOTE

    This project is Proof-of-Contept for those people, who ask me to add "Flash functionality" to testcookie-nginx-module.
    Check the "doc" directory for the list of things you can do yourself.

INSTALLATION

    Grab and install libraries:
        1) My fork of libming (http://github.com/kyprizel/libming.git), don't forget to compile and install Python extension
        2) Fapws (https://github.com/william-os4y/fapws3)
        3) Swfobject (http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/)

    Build nginx with testcookie-nginx-module, use example configuration.
    Run testcookie-flash-processor, run nginx.
